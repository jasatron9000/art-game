# Art Game -> Which is Older?

## Introduction
This is a simple game that uses a [Public API](https://www.artic.edu/open-access/public-api) courtesy of The Art Institute of Chicago which provides access to the artwork that can be seen throughout this game. The aim of the game is to guess which art is the older one out of the two choices presented, and see how long you can last without getting anything wrong.

The site can be accessed from this [link](https://jasatron9000.github.io/art-game).
